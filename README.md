# Creating_Customer_Segments
This is my third Udacity Machine Learning Engineer nanodegree project.

- To view my work, open the creating_customer_segments.ipynb file. The rest are supporting files or less readable formats of the same work.

- As the name suggests, this project is centered on the creation of a machine learning model capable of being used by a wholesale distributor to determine the different types of customers that it has, so that it may offer a new customer the type service that has been most useful for similar customers.

- This Jupyter Notebook project comprised of Python code blocks with my contributions including the word 'Implementation' in the section header, and with the 'TODO' keyword in the comments preceding my code contribution. 

- Furthermore, there are 12 conceptual questions that I have answered thoroughly and demonstrate my understanding of the data and the work that I engaged in with it.

# Main Concepts
- The main machine learning concepts covered in this project include the following:

- Data Exploration: This included determining basic statistical breakdown of the dataset, making a hypothesis as to what the different types of clients are based on their feature values, and then determining which features are most relevant for distinguishing the different customer types from each other.
- Data Preprocessing: Applied feature scaling to generate a more normal distribution of the data, and made a decision about how to treat outliers
- Feature Transformation: 
- Evaluating Model Performance: Discussed and made use of techniques such as Grid Search and K-fold Cross Validation to tune hyperparameters and make sure that model derives strong insights from the data. Then, made predictions with the model and made a determination as to whether the model in its current form is ready to be used in the real world.
